Sytyc - Programming Puzzles
===========================
If you're here, you probably can program in at least one language.  Perhaps you
wanted to learn a new language, or perhaps you just wanted to tackle some 
programming challenges.

Whatever the reason is, welcome.


Get Started
-----------
If you're a first-timer,
[check out the list of problems here](problems.cgi). Get your 
compiler or interpreter and your favourite IDE ready, and start coding.
All problems use the standard output for printing, and standard input for
reading.


Got questions?
--------------
There is a list of [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.cgi). If your question 
isn't on the list, you can [give us a shout](feedback.cgi).


What is Sytyc?
--------------
Sytyc is an interface where you can view programming puzzles, and submit your
answers in source code.  It's entirely written in Haskell, and runs via CGI on
any web browser.  It's also a great place to learn programming.
